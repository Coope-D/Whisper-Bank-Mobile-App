# Whisper Bank Mobile App README

A design pattern exercise for a fictional mobile app called Whisper Bank. The design includes the following artefacts:

* The user flows for the app (https://github.com/Coope-D/Whisper-Bank-Mobile-App/blob/master/user-flows/user-flows-diagram.pdf).
* Wireframes for the primary (or most interesting) user flow (https://github.com/Coope-D/Whisper-Bank-Mobile-App/blob/master/wireframes/deposit-cheque-user-flow.pdf or https://xd.adobe.com/view/5b971181-25b8-4319-9293-96c27f7bc241/).
* High fidelity screen mockups of the primary (or most interesting) screen (https://github.com/Coope-D/Whisper-Bank-Mobile-App/blob/master/high-fidelity-screen-mockups/dashboard-screen.pdf).
